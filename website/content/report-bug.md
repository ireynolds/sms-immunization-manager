# Reporting Bugs

Submit bug reports by emailing __________ (TODO: 481 staff's choice--an email they choose and control). 

1. An email subject that briefly describes the unwanted behavor.
2. A sequence of steps to reproduce the unwanted behavior (or the body of an SMS message that caused the behavior).
3. A longer description of the unwanted behavior as well as a description of the desired behavior.

Here's an example:

### Subject: "SL" operation always reports for facility 123.

1. Register a new user for some facility other than 123.
2. Have that user send "SL A 100".

Unwanted behavior: the "effects" for that message show that it used facility 123.

Desired behavior: the stock level is reported for the users's registered facility, not 123.
