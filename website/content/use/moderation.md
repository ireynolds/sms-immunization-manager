Moderation Instructions
==================

* toc
{:toc}

The moderation web interface provides designated moderators the ability to monitor the interactions with SIM. Moderators can will be altered to any SMS messages sent to SIM that generated errors.

## Viewing Regions

After logging in, the region hierarchy is navigable from the panel labeled Sub-Regions. As you navigate deeper into the hierarchy you can backup using the breadcrumb links at the top of the page. Each region will display it's facilities in the Facilities panel. It is possible for a region to have no facilities and only include sub-regions.

## Adding SMS Users

Moderators can add a user by navigating to a facility and clicking the "plus" button. This will grant the new user the ability to report for this facility via SMS messages.

## Message History

Each SMS user will have a history of the messages they sent and the responses sent back to them. All messages are shown in chronological order with the most recent message at the top. Moderators can view the details of an incoming message by clicking *Show Effects* button. This will display a detailed log of SIM's interpretation of the message and the actions it generated.

## Errors

Regions, Facilities, and Users with unviewed messages that have errors will be flagged with an aggregated count of the errors. This is meant to alert the moderator to a possible issue with the received SMS messages.

## Correcting Errors

Messages with errors can be corrected by the moderator and submitted again. When a message has an error the *Resend Message* button will appear. Clicking it gives the ability to correct the message and submit it for processing again. Correcting the error in an SMS message might not always be possible. In those cases it is recommended that the moderator contact the sender to ensure that the data gets submitted correctly.

## Dismissing Errors

Ideally if a user submitted a malformed message, the will have received a response, and corrected their error in a subsequent message. In this case the moderator can dismiss the error using the *Dismiss Error* or *Dismiss All* buttons.
