# The Google Drive Repository

{:toc}

The Google Drive repository is shared [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B793yuhL-L3GbFdUeklDUmRPVXc&usp=sharing). If you want to edit or add content, [contact us](/about) for permissions.

## Content

The Google Drive repository was created to disseminate information; formalize requirements and architecture documentation; record configuration instructions; and provide background materials for new engineers working with Django, RapidSMS, Git/GitHub, and other technologies. 

For that reason, some of its content is irrelevant and some duplicates materials on this documentation site. It would be best to remove the Google Drive, moving some content to a GitHub Wiki, some to this website, and deleting the rest.

## Organization

In the repository you will find the following structure:

    ├── Agendas and Minutes
    ├── Deliverables
    ├── Dev Tools and Processes
    ├── Documentation
    ├── Research
	    └── images

The folders are briefly described below:

`Agendas and Minutes`: Contains notes from significant meetings with each other, customers, and users.

`Deliverables`: Contains submitted assignments for CSE 490D and CSE 481K, the two UW courses during which this application's first version was developed. This includes presentation slides, presentation notes, poster designs, and architecture diagrams.

`Dev Tools and Processes`: Contains documentation of our software tools, setup processes, and development processes. 

`Documentation`: Contains documentation of architectural decisions.

`Research`: Contains materials about requirements, related systems, and deployment gathered from a previous team's experience building a prototype of a similar system deployed in Laos. 
* `images`: Images of the cold chain facilities, equipment, and workers in Laos.
